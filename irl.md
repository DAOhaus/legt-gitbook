Physical assets have long been deemed as "illiquid" because the process associated with making them liquid has been very cumbersome. &#x20;

With our tools and processes we will make this accessible to anyone that is willing to spend the blockchain fees associated with minting tokens, which will vary per chain.

In connecting the NFT to an Asset Token we can supply an Automated Market Making (AMM) contract with both with the Asset Token and Stable Token (USD) to offer to all token holders the ability to liquidate up to a certain percentage of the asset's value.

This will provide benefits such as:

* ongoing price discovery as the price will change with each buy or sale and can be assured to increase with correct strategies in place
* fractional reserve liquidity ie 20% of an asset available in cash
* price pegging upon creation to your perceived value
* staking opportunities for loans & other defi products

While anyone can do this with anything, our [L£GT ĐAO](dao.md) will specialize in offering a tailored experience to assets we find attractive.  In doing so we will partner and offer loans to asset holders and provide services to facilitate smooth operations. &#x20;
