Sound confusing?  Let's break it down 🧑🏼‍🏫

We are developing a [Decentralized Autonomous Organization](dao.md) to find [Real World Assets](rwa.md), who's ownership and other general rights will be connected to both Fungible and Non Fungible [Tokens](rwa.md).  \
\
This will be achieved by linking [Legal Contracts](ai.md) to bridge these assets into new [Decentralized Finance](irl/) ecosystems to provide [Instant Real Liquidity](irl/) and other financial and [governance products](why.md) for previously illiquid assets.

Basically it's a more open, modular & accessible ecosystem for RWA tokens similar to projects like [centrifuge](https://centrifuge.io/), [mattereum](https://mattereum.com/) or [mantra](https://www.mantrachain.io/) built to be jurisdictionally / asset / chain agnostic.\
\
Tony Nacumoto, the lead dev & visionary behind the protocol is a blockchain veteran that lost a substantial amount in the collapse of USDT and has since set out on a mission to re-define how we think about stable coins by basing them in assets that one intrinsically wants to own, utilize and enjoy.  Think of it as a protocol to empower groups of people to create their own stable coins and mix that with an abundance-mindset social club that is empowered to share toys & experiences (v2) and you've got [L£GT](https://legt.co)\
