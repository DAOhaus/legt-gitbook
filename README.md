# intrø

We are developing a [Decentralized Autonomous Organization](dao.md) to find [Real World Assets](rwa.md), who's ownership and other general rights will be connected to both Fungible and Non Fungible [Tokens](rwa.md).  \
\
This will be achieved by linking [legal contracts](ai.md) to bridge assets from any jurisdiction into our new [decentralized finance](irl/) ecosystems to provide [instant real liquidity](irl/) and other financial and [governance products](why.md) for previously illiquid assets.

Basically it's a more open, modular & accessible ecosystem for RWA tokens similar to projects like [centrifuge](https://centrifuge.io/), [mattereum](https://mattereum.com/) or [mantra](https://www.mantrachain.io/) built to be jurisdictionally / asset / chain agnostic.\
\
The lead dev & visionary behind the protocol is a blockchain veteran that since losing a substantial amount in the collapse of Terra's UST has set out on a mission to re-define how we think about stablecoins by basing them in assets that one intrinsically wants to own, utilize and enjoy.  All empowered through a modular, open and permissionless protocol.

Think of it as a group of people that collectively own homes and other assets around the world, create amazing experiences and govern themselves via their own ecosystem of stable and **L**egally **E**mpowered **G**overnance **T**okens.  That's [L£GT](https://legt.co) \
