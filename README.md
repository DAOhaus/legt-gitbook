# intrø

We are developing a [Decentralized Autonomous Organization](dao.md) to find [Real World Assets](rwa.md), who's ownership and other general rights will be connected to both Fungible and Non Fungible [Tokens](rwa.md).  \
\
This will be achieved by linking [legal contracts](ai.md) to bridge assets from any jurisdiction into our new [decentralized finance](irl/) ecosystems to provide [instant real liquidity](irl/) and other financial and [governance products](why.md) for previously illiquid assets.

Basically it's a permissionless, modular & accessible ecosystem for RWA tokens similar to projects like [centrifuge](https://centrifuge.io/), [mattereum](https://mattereum.com/) or [mantra](https://www.mantrachain.io/) built to be jurisdictionally, asset & chain agnostic.\
\
The lead dev & visionary behind the protocol is a blockchain veteran that lost a substantial amount in the collapse of Terra's UST has set out on a mission to re-define how we think about stablecoins by basing them in assets that one intrinsically wants to own, utilize and enjoy.  All empowered through a modular and permissionless web3 pure protocol.

Think of it being used by a group of people that collectively own homes and other assets around the world to create amazing experiences and govern themselves via their own ecosystem of stablecoins backed by **L**egally **E**mpowered **G**overnance **T**okens in the form of an [NFTitle](irl/nfloans.md) that they can use in defi in lieu of legacy mortgage and title loan products. It's not a time-share, it's an equity-share.\
\
We have a functioning MVP that allows you to mint an NFT with a linked agreement document and liquid token, and that's [L£GT](https://legt.co).\
