# rwƒÅ nft

In order to allow DAOs to own and manage assets, they must have their assets turned into blockchain tokens. This is the primary focus of the software we develop: **make it easy for a physical asset to be represented and managed via blockchain tokens.**\
\
Let's clear up any confusion between NFT & Token terminology.  A **Non Fungible Token** represents anything that is a 1 of 1.  Things with a unique identifier such as a serial or VIN number would fall into this category.  A **Fungible Token** is anything that you only care about quantity of that item, not individually assigned.  This would cover things like voting shares or currency amounts.

To link these together we will use legal contracts and smart contracts.  Each jurisdiction will require it's own kind of legal contracts, which we will cover more in-depth in the [AI](ai.md) section, however for smart contracts we will depending upon our 1776 Token Standard which includes attributes:

* override functions for the DAO to call
* linking variables that point to URLs and Token Addresses that pertain to its governance and ownership such as "linked erc20", "linked nft", "linked legal", etc.&#x20;
* chain agnostic & meta-standard compliant as they will be combined with many other chains, processes and standards.
