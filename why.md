# why

As inevitable as phone books being put onto the internet, asset titles and ownership will be put onto the blockchain.  Sure, physical only items will always exist with off-chain financial tools, there is just a more democratized and effective way of doing the same thing now and we are working on creating the easiest to use and flexible system for it. &#x20;

It embodies the sentiment of going boldly into the future, harnessing the power of technology üöÄ

While we are focused on the technical execution we don't fully know the cultural implementations, but are excited by them.

It has the ability to technically underpin a resurgence of collective ownership, that if correctly harnessed will usher in things like the end of poverty & needless homelessness, asset backed currencies, universal basic income, regenerative farming & economics, creative work production and more...&#x20;

This type of system is not a question of ‚Äúif‚Äù but rather a matter of ‚Äúwhen‚Äù that in the right hands could lead to improved socio-economic patterns for all.
